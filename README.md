# 3D Simulation of Dijkstra's Algorithm

To visualize the Dijkstra's algorithm in a 3D environment, I created a simulation using vpython. The simulation demonstrates the shortest path algorithm in action, showing how the algorithm calculates the shortest path between two points in a 3D space. Participated in Kibo Robot Programming Challenge 2023.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository in your local machine.
1. Install the depedencies using `pip`.
   ``` bash
   pip install vpython
   ```
2. Run the `simulator_v1.py` file.
